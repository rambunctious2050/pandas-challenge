Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a video game in which players can make purchases within the game as they advance through the levels. A dataset containing the items purchased by the players is provided. The challenge is to analyze the dataset to find different trends in purchasing behavior. 

1. I first printed out the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand the nature of the data.
2. Then I calculated the number of unique players.
3. I calculated the number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total revenue.
4. Next I cut the dataset with gender types to find the total number of Male, Female and Other/Non-disclosed players.
5. Using that information, I calculated the purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value and average purchase total per person by gender.
6. Next I cut the dataset by age ranges and calculated the same metrics as in step 5.
7. Finally, I found the top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items, each time conducting a similar version of the metrics calculated in step 5.

Top 3 Takeaways/Trends:
1. The total revenue generated from 780 in-app purchases is $2,379,77. 
2. The majority of players (~84%) identify as male and 45% of total players are in the 20-24 age range. Both of these groups contribute to the majority of purchases.
3. Items "Final Critic" (Item ID 92) and "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" (Item ID 178) were the most popular and profitable items.
