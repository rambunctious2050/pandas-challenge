Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a video game in which players can make purchases within the game as they advance through the levels. A dataset containing the items purchased by the players is provided. The challenge is to analyze the dataset to find different trends in purchasing behavior. 

1. I first printed out the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand the nature of the data.
2. Then I calculated the number of unique players.
3. I calculated the number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total revenue.
4. Next I cut the dataset with gender types to find the total number of Male, Female and Other/Non-disclosed players.
5. Using that information, I calculated the purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value and average purchase total per person by gender.
6. Next I cut the dataset by age ranges and calculated the same metrics as in step 5.
7. Finally, I found the top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items, each time conducting a similar version of the metrics calculated in step 5.
